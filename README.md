Build a Bayesian Network on Reach for Health study data 

We applied probabilistic Bayesian networks to elicit bio-behavioral pathways implicated in obesity and health 
in breast cancer survivorship. Our sample comprised 333 well-characterized postmenopausal breast cancer survivors 
with objective physical activity assessments, and detailed information on multiple lifestyle factors, clinical 
characteristics, and health measures. Using this unique sample, we developed Bayesian networks to model 
inter-relationships between health behaviors (sleep, physical activity), body mass index (BMI), biomarkers of 
inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP]) and glucose regulation (insulin), and mental and physical quality of life.
